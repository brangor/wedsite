# brangor / wedsite

**This is a work-in-progress for a website for my wedding**

It's using some style tweaks from [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) and a largely modified [gatsby template](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension). 

## Running it
Clone it, nav to it in the terminal, and run `gatsby develop` to start the dev site.
